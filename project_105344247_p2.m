                Solving the Spatial S.I.R Model
Description: Solves the Spatial S.I.R Model 
Inputs: RK4.m, ode45.m, dynamicsSIR.m, solveSpatialSIR.m, plotTimeSeries.m,
        animate.m
Outputs: Times solving SIR model using ODE45 as the differential equation
        solver against a custom RK4 solver & displays to command window.
        Plots local SIR model at specified point in space & saves graph to
        current folder. Creates animation of spatial SIR model and saves to
        current folder.
