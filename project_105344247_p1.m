                Main Component Analysis with PCA
Description: Implements Principal Component Analysis on COVID-19 data from
             27 countries. Reduces data from 6 variables to 2 variables and
             creates a biplot.
Inputs: myPCA.m
Outputs: Graph of normalized data projected onto the principal components.
Method: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
